======
- Switch to using sublime and compiling with the command line
- Is there a way to access memory like a struct disregarding padding/alignment (e.g., to directly read a WAV header?)

- Using @_silgen_name is probably scary. Remove eventually.
- Move build script into file, have build script call it
